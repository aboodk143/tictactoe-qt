# tictactoe-qt

Project Overview:
an advanced version of Tic Tac Toe game that incorporates user authentication,
personalized game history, and an intelligent (Artificial Intelligent) AI opponent. The game will
support both player-vs-player and player-vs-AI modes, allowing users to log in, track their game
history, and analyze past games. The project will employ best practices in software
engineering, including secure user management, rigorous testing, and professional version
control workflows.




Core Components:
Game Logic Implementation:
● Develop the basic game mechanics allowing two players and a player and AI to
take turns marking a 3x3 grid.
● Implement game rules to check for a win or a tie after each move.
AI Opponent:
● Integrate a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to power the AI opponent,
enabling it to make strategic moves based on the game state. You can use other
techniques to develop the AI agent
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
● Design a GUI that displays the Tic Tac Toe board and allows players to interact
with the game through clicks.
● Include additional GUI elements for managing user sessions, including login
forms, registration forms, and game history views.
User Authentication and Management:
● Implement a secure login and registration system where players can create
accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
● Use password hashing for secure storage of credentials and session
management for keeping users logged in.
Personalized Game History:
● Allow players to save and view their game histories, with details about each
game session stored securely in an efficient format.
● Enable players to review and replay past games from their history.
Testing and Quality Assurance:
● Develop comprehensive unit tests using Google Test to validate each component
of the game.
● Implement integration tests to ensure all parts of the system work together
seamlessly.
CI/CD Integration:
● Set up GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment processes,
ensuring that updates are smoothly rolled out and maintain high code quality.
Performance Optimization and Metrics:
● Monitor and optimize the game’s performance, focusing on metrics such as
response time and system resource utilization.
Implementation Details:
Technologies and Tools:
● Programming Language: C++
● Use Object Oriented Programming techniques
● Testing Framework: Google Test for unit and integration testing.
● Version Control System: Git, with GitHub as the remote repository.
● CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
● Database: SQLite or a similar lightweight database system for managing user data and
game histories. You can also using a customized file storage with a format of your
choice
● Security Practices: Use of secure hashing algorithms for password storage
● GUI Framework: Qt or similar libraries suitable for C++.
Data Structures:
● Trees for implementing the minimax algorithm for the AI opponent.
● Other data structures like stacks, hashtables and others can be used in different parts
of the system
